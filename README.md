Joint reconstruction of multiple microbial interaction networks from multiple conditions

Abstract 

Motivation: Microorganisms living on and inside human bodies constitute complex ecological interaction webs, which may have positive or negative effects on the host. Constructing microbiome-wide microbial association networks based on data sets from different conditions may help us understand human health and disease. 

Results: In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso(EDOHA), to identify multiple microbial networks with common and speciﬁc hub microbes. To be speciﬁc, we construct a penalized log likelihood optimization problem using log ratios of count or proportion data and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM) algorithm. The performance of the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing hub microbes than the existing comparable methods. We also apply our method to mouse skin microbial data from three conditions. Both common and conditions-speciﬁc hub microbes are identiﬁed with higher accuracy.
