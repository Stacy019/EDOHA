Extended Graphical Lasso for Multiple Interaction Networks for High Dimensional Omics Data

Abstractï¼š
There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To
be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods.
